This widget allows you to display a map using an static image. Useful for
displaying indoor maps and other kind of maps not related to the earth
surface.

Display markers and geometries inside the map by connecting this widget to other
widgets/operators. Users will be able to interact with those PoI and geometries
and those events will be also propagated using the wiring.

This is a simplified version of the `ol3-map` widget, the latter can also be
used for displaying static maps and can be useful for complex scenarios, e.g.
scenarios requiring mixing layers or being able to switch between different
base layers.
